Hi Christian,
Appreciate the comments. 

The picture should be like Facebook does it when posting a link.

Every member of a cloud should be able to move a link into a sub cloud. The feature specification do though have an error: It should not be possible to move a link from one cloud to another. Only to copy/paste.

Evry member of a cloud should be able to delete a link. Only cloud creator can delete the whole cloud.

This way the admin settings should be almost as flat and simple as possible. 

Design is initially not included in the project.

I think the estimated period for development is fair. I do though believe that the guesstimated price is a bit high compared to my expectations of this project. I do though appreciate your good communication and understanding of the project.

What language would you code this in?
